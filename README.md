# TrainPixels LED Control System

## Overview
TrainPixels are a track simulation built with python to simulate a "Retro Swedish Trainway Tacking Wall" previously used by the Swedish Railway Institution; Banverket (today Trafikverket). The script uses NeoPixel (WS2812) LED strips and is built for a RaspberryPie. It also support local debugging without the hardware by using dummy functions.

## Configuration

Example:
```json
{
  "TRACK_PIXEL_LENGTH": 42,
  "UTIL_PIXEL_LENGTH": 44,
  "TRACK_PIN": "D19",
  "UTIL_PIN": "D21",
  "STATUS_UTIL_LED": 13,
  "BRIGHTNESS": 0.2,
  "TRACK_SPEED_MODIFIER": 0.2,
  "RANDOM_UTIL_TRIGGER_CHANCE": 0,
  "COLOR_TABLE": {
    "red": [255, 0, 0, 0.3],
    "green": [0, 255, 0, 0.2],
    "white": [255, 255, 255, 0.2],
    "blue": [0, 0, 255, 0.5],
    "yellow": [255, 255, 0, 0.5],
    "purple": [128, 0, 128, 0.5],
    "off": [0, 0, 0, 0.5],
    "status_indicator_green": [0, 255, 0, 0.1],
    "status_indicator_yellow": [255, 255, 0, 0.1],
    "status_indicator_red": [255, 0, 0, 0.1]
  }
}
```

## Track & Event Files
- Place track files in `src/tracks.d/` (see `track_01.json`, `track_02.json` for format)
- Supported `~/.config/trainpixels/tracks.d/` or `~/Desktop/tracks.d/`
- Place event files in `src/utils.d/`
- Supported `~/.config/trainpixels/utils.d/` or `~/Desktop/utils.d/`

## Usage
1. run `start.sh` 

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure your config and track/event files are valid JSON
- If no tracks/events are found, the script will exit
- For hardware errors, check your wiring and pin settings
